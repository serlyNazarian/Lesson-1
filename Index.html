        Robert James Fischer (March 9, 1943 – January 17, 2008) was an American
        chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion. A chess
        prodigy, at age 14 he won the 1958 U.S. Championship. In 1964, he won
        the same tournament with a perfect score (11 wins). Qualifying for the
        1972 World Championship, Fischer swept matches with Mark Taimanov and
        Bent Larsen by 6–0 scores. After another qualifying match against Tigran
        Petrosian, Fischer won the title match against Boris Spassky of the
        USSR, in Reykjavík, Iceland. Publicized as a Cold War confrontation
        between the US and USSR, the match attracted more worldwide interest
        than any chess championship before or since. In 1975, Fischer refused to
        defend his title when an agreement could not be reached with FIDE,
        chess's international governing body, over the match conditions. As a
        result, the Soviet challenger Anatoly Karpov was named World Champion by
        default. Fischer subsequently disappeared from the public eye, though
        occasional reports of erratic behavior emerged. In 1992, he reemerged to
        win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia,
        which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation
        led to a conflict with the US government, which warned Fischer that his
        participation in the match would violate an executive order imposing US
        sanctions on Yugoslavia. The US government ultimately issued a warrant
        for his arrest. After that, Fischer lived as an émigré. In 2004, he was
        arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport that
        the US government had revoked. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic
        passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing,
        allowing him to live there until his death in 2008. Fischer made
        numerous lasting contributions to chess. His book My 60 Memorable Games,
        published in 1969, is regarded as essential reading in chess literature.
        In the 1990s, he patented a modified chess timing system that added a
        time increment after each move, now a standard practice in top
        tournament and match play. He also invented Fischer random chess, also
        known as Chess960, a chess variant in which the initial position of the
        pieces is randomized to one of 960 possible positions.
